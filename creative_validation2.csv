pf03798.83,"Sam Beam had just released the Woman King EP, which added a few new musical twists to his disarmingly intimate acoustic songs, and he was two years away from releasing The Shepherd's Dog, which would redirect the next decade of his music into ever more elaborate jazz-folk compositions."
pf03967.2,"Though Vince has outgrown the tape, his life fills it crags, his experiences guide its voice, his temerity forges something from nothing."
pf04244.18,"Not long into her fourth solo album, On the Line, Jenny Lewis introduces a narcoleptic poet from Duluth, with whom she spars over everything from Elliott Smith to grenadine; a father who used to sing a little ditty about all the years he threw away on heroin; an East Side girl called Caroline, to whom a lover is bitterly lost."
pf04715.16,But this record sees her playing with the predictable patterns of songwriting.
pf04733.9,"Their consistently patient approach is a signature, evoking Tony Conrad's way of concentrating his tuning by playing deliberately slowly, as well as Earth's decades-long aversion to rushing through a song."
pf05167.34,"But the assertiveness with which Vainio and Vigroux navigate leaps in frequency, or from claustrophobic hiss to echoing expanse, indicates that these artists already know their way around this uneven ground—or at least are coolly unsurprised when the floor gives way beneath them."

pf10327.14,"On Chicago x 12, a single from 2007s Asleep at Heavens Gate, Zach Rogue expressed the dissonance between his bands critical acclaim and their demoralizing tours with one heartbreaking line: it dont matter/cause no one comes out to see us."

pf10826.16,"Songs like Casanova find Shapiro trying to reconcile the past of a current lover (Forgive my ugliness should I find out/ Something that I dont want to know about), playing a Casanova to the mentally ill, which is wryly funny if youre casually familiar with even a tenth of Greens music."

pf11862.7,"Goldfrapp have spent the past decade moving back and forth between icy electro-glam and atmospheric balladry, delivering these extremes in tonally consistent albums that dare to alienate listeners who favor one style over the other."

pf14694.16,"Producer and electronic noisemaker Helge Sten is probably responsible for the albums extreme dynamic range, which is half the show: What they play is far less engrossing than how they amplify it, sometimes excruciatingly, with the rotation of the Leslie speakers raised to a gale force bellow."
pf14728.15,"Despite some Pinetop Seven-recalling gothic textures (The Birds on the Bridge, written by bassist Chris Mason, is a sinister paean to paranoia) and jam-banding noodles (The Sun Never Shines), Deep Dark Woods-- particularly Boldt-- keep emotions tightly wrapped, opaque."

pf16990.10,"And besides, Jarmans more charismatic when pointing the finger at himself: Im a realist/ Im a romantic, he sings on Im a Realist, before drawing attention to that admissions inherent contradiction: Im an indecisive piece of shit."

pf17308.1,Ramblin Jack Elliott first met Woody Guthrie in Coney Island in Febuary 1951.
pf17499.21,"This new album nearly summarizes the bands career thus far, shining light on unmined and forgotten (sometimes for good reason) sounds and genres from the not-too-distant past but forgoing most of their less-advisable indulgences."

pf18818.6,(Troubles isnt much better.
pf18953.3,"Resilience is the latest in this line, and here Kid606 really puts himself in an artistically vulnerable place, dedicating the record to his mom, putting a photo of a young child on the cover (looks like Depedro at age three), and proclaiming that he didnt want to die without releasing Resilience."
pf19057.13,"Sounds like Brainiac, you say?"
pf19162.39,"Song Beneath the Song takes cues from B-level James Van Der Beek dialogue, repeating its not a love song over a monotonous, textbook I-IV-V chord progression."
pf19857.5,"21.50: Beat breaks into breakbeat, soul goes all neo-."
pf19967.18,"If you were fast enough, you could make it in eight minutes, but it depended on the absence of cops, and you had to have a good car-- like a Corvette, the kind Sheriff Buford Pusser crashed on the same stretch back in 1974, a little over a year after the first biopic of his life, Walking Tall, was released."
pf19990.29,"His early material, like Conmigo, Butterflies and My Sister, possesses an exuberance derived perhaps from the need to entertain audiences impatient for headliners."
pf20424.8,"Elsewhere, Goughs lyrics are regrettably schmaltzy, as on Year of the Rat he croons (with some help from a completely unironic childrens choir), Everybody needs to know its the year of the rat/ Everyday weve got to hold on/ Cause if we hold on, we could find some new energy."
pf20649.47,"In some stupid way, they were-- at least to fourth graders in Denton, Texas-- but it wasnt until puberty that I realized there was a whole other world of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King Diamond, Slayer and Napalm Death out there."
pf20708.13,What were they doing?!

pf21241.13,Kawabata Makoto makes the electric guitar sound like its been around for a thousand years.
pf21524.3,"Similar in sound to The Magnetic Fields, The Tall Dwarfs, and the more orchestral moments of Belle & Sebastian, the album begins with strings, organ, and a flourish of harps and voices."
pf21568.22,"Because of the sheer oddness of most of the source music, people whove heard anything by the group will have no trouble picking out phrases and textures here and there."

pf22501.23,"At the door, he reacquaints himself with his reflection in the window, and knocks."
pf23263.15,"Not that the other elements are all lace and frills, but after the first few seconds of the brief and blistering album opener, Wheres my Social Worker?, it becomes apparent that Check Engine build their songs from the rhythm section up, which they are smart to do-- they know where their bread is buttered."
