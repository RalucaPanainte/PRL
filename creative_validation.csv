pf00019.18,"Williams has masked prosaic lyrics with her booming voice in the past, but without a melody as her guide, she comes across as uninspired."
pf00196.36,"In that sense, Die Cut / City Planning feels like a record without a center of gravity, no matter how enjoyable the drifting may be."
pf00246.3,"When Tucker belts “take the noise in my head,” each syllable razor-sharp, you can’t help but feel a sense of urgency."
pf00305.26,"Along the way, he tapped into places in his creative mind he’d never been before."
pf00472.8,"Tomu DJ’s attempts to fuse these two approaches didn’t always gel, though last year’s debut full-length, FEMINISTA, was a fine statement of intent."
pf00828.6,"It’s not because his music is particularly that great, though he’s had some incredibly memorable moments: the 2019 ad-lib barrage “Big Drip” is one of the most fun hits of Brooklyn drill’s creative apex, and his Funk Flex freestyle and guest verse on Kanye West’s Donda showed off some lyrical chops."
pf00868.3,"“Cheap hooks can’t sell if there’s no honesty,” Wilder sings over rudimentary piano toward the start of album opener “Beginning Again,” later sniping that “I can’t help your shitty attitude.”"
pf01065.15,"A century’s worth of ambient tropes swirl together in “Pseudolove,” where Satie-like piano chords commingle with pitch-bent strings reminiscent of the steel guitar of the KLF’s Chill Out."
pf01362.10,"Instead, Keem uses the opportunity to expand his well-established fascination with trap and melody to feature-length—with mixed results."
pf01873.15,"It’s occasionally scattershot, but the songwriter's refusal to streamline his weirdness is a gift."
pf01887.18,"Braiding strands of ambient, experimental folk, early music, and modern classical, the couple’s compositions are resonant and deeply stirring."
pf01954.21,But there’s a renewed energy to his offering.
pf02017.1,Yasmin Williams has described her approach to acoustic guitar as a kind of creative problem-solving.
pf02059.13,"These production choices work well with Father’s singing, smoothing his coarse bangers into catchy, almost cutesy lullabies."
pf02108.29,"Pushing forward in needling eighth-note phrases, his solos can be a little too insistent, his cadenzas too lily-gilding."
pf02857.17,"Morrissey spends his time at odds with himself, unsure whether he is a decadent Wildean type, a devious free-thinker, or a shock dispensary here to alert the masses that their world is ugly, misshapen, and obscene."
pf02877.3,"Even those descriptors fail to capture the full complexity of Anderson’s singular production style, which is inherently soulful, but also dark, psychedelic, and a bit unsettling."
pf03159.1,Skin is a boundary that Jesse Kanda trespasses in his visual works.
pf03616.5,It also led to a debut album that was hugely ambitious in sound and scope (Smith cited 2016’s The Life of Pablo as its primary inspiration) but failed to show any potential beyond its shiny production value.
pf03849.62,Histories of jazz that emphasize the development of the melodic line—as epitomized by the emergence of bebop in the mid-’40s—tend to overshadow the changes in the underlying musical environment.
pf04512.17,"Carlson sings in a robotic voice about a journey across the universe with a talking bird, once again escaping the mundanity of earthly existence for adventure in another world—or, as she puts it, “crossing the line from boring to obscene.”"
pf04632.14,Vocal-loop stylist Julianna Barwick’s contribution to “Saccade” is another ideal marriage of a collaborator’s skills and an overarching style: Her drawn-out notes complement the day-spa tranquility conjured by soothing synths and soft rhythms.
pf05449.21,"Kamaiyah has been compared to Missy Elliott, as an inventive rap artist with a clear aesthetic vision who also rocks colorful jumpsuits, which is exemplified by the tasteful “Fashion,” a song that feels retro and chic all at once."
pf06087.36,"They weren’t original or innovative (Harumi Hosono and Midori Takada made “beach” records of their own years earlier), but the songs make you want to make you kick your feet up, and imagine yourself a world away."
pf06635.18,"A low-key release, maybe, but if you just want to just listen to some stalwart rhymes over brass-knuckle beats, Rude One proves an excellent foil."
pf06698.26,"These might sound annoying, but buoyed by the immediacy of their music, they simply feel honest."
pf06731.1,"You’d be forgiven for thinking that, after a playful and prolific run through most of the 2000s, the peculiar electronic music producer Jan Jelinek had taken an extended break."
pf07300.18,"And when you’re dealing with the pinnacle of human innovation and the symbol of death, that subject deserves to take center stage."
pf07356.6,Hitch isn't just a retread of the band's previous work; it's a summation of all the ways the Alternative Nation has under-delivered since the new millennium.
pf07670.12,"On ""Platforming"", meanwhile, Wendel's fantastic Art Pepper-esque tenor work is transformed into a wild, distorted-violin sound."
pf08220.31,"Ka’s sound is so specific that it is easy to hear a new release, register it as more of the same, and coast through it."
pf08377.21,"But somehow, This World Is Not Enough is too cluelessly conceived and sloppily executed to get very mad about it."
pf08586.15,"But the heavy traditional soul-jazz/boom-bap backing is at least well-executed, and the occasional shakeup via drum'n'bass-adjacent uptempo breaks (""Escape 120""; bonus track ""Teach Me"") is welcome."
pf09077.9,"“Papi Pacify” becomes a slow blues seduction, not too far from FKA twigs’ original in tone and setting, but Calvi draws out the ""ooh""’s leading up to the chorus and settles into the languorous guitar chords afterwards."
pf09326.13,"The results are warm and almost meditative: synth pads that evoke sunbeams, choral multitracking that sounds like General MIDI voice patches."
pf09463.6,"Artists such as Steve Moore, Norm Chambers (Jürgen Müller, Panabrite), Steve Hauschildt, and Jorge Velez (Professor Genius) are just a handful of artists who've released exciting works in the genre recently."
pf09583.22,"are some hooks highlighted on the record, statements so vapid and feckless they make the bulk of Twitter on any given day seem Pulitzer-worthy."
pf10457.8,"Later this year, Relapse will issue new LPs from both bands, something they’re teasing with the new, three-track split album Reflection of the Negative."
pf10480.28,"The most promising development is his indulged fondness for various permutations of R&B and gospel styles, best evidenced on the album’s great first single “Retrograde.”"
pf10625.12,"The beats are consistently surprising-- coherent and steady one moment, and filled with static the next-- and they complement Geti's off-kilter musings nicely."
pf10944.7,"For the most part, however, Young Hunger's fat bass, bongo breakdowns, and Manuel's bell-like tenor sound closer to 1980s and 90s balladeers that might never be ironically cool or good, like Billy Ocean (especially on ""Young Hunger"") or George Michael."
pf11067.11,"On the new songs, he still favors the perspectives of ne'er-do-wells, slobs, misfits, and outcasts, not because he identifies with them but because they make better punchlines."
pf11570.11,"It may actually be best to just pretend that H.N.I.C. 3 ends after the 10th song, because up to that point it's a pretty good, if slightly uninspiring, mixtape."
pf12386.3,"And while Silkie augmented his developing sound with occasional detours into ""purple"" bass and evergreen boogie funk, what stood out was an overarching style that didn't see a mutual exclusion between cocktail-lounge ambiance and tons of wobbly bass."
pf12539.14,"The record also occasionally sounds too polished-- the production is generally very good, but without even a trace of grit or noise it can feel a bit neutered at times."
pf13636.14,"Durig is equally creative, slashing his chords across the songs like a whip across skin."
pf13644.13,"Kings Go Forth run through soul-revue rave-ups as well as midtempo vocal-group numbers, and they even dabble in reggae on the snaky ""1000 Songs""."
pf14063.9,"Those albums came equipped with a restless, inventive sense of fun."
pf14262.5,"It's not that Pens don't have the steps down or that the dance is tired, but this particular brand of raucous, don't-give-a-fuck pogo-fuel can't be this empty and boring."
pf14465.4,"Even Edenloff's nasal, impassioned singing and lyricism are practically naked in their straightforward sincerity."
pf14619.20,"They may not be adding much to the neo-Nuggets formula, but their channeling of those fuzzed-out relics of rock history is so painstakingly slipshod, so studiedly aggressive, and so exuberantly ominous, that listeners won't give a fig about the lack of novelty."
pf14760.24,"And here and there, he shows flashes of his old inventiveness: ""Young shooter, in the Chevy with Punky Brewster."""
pf15443.8,"This Is Ivy League don't entirely skirt these pitfalls: ""Viola"", ""Modern World"", and ""Visions of Tokyo"" come across as pastiche, imitative rather than innovative."
pf15860.12,"It flows like a dubbed-out late night jam session, moving from idea to idea as the musicians come and go and take breaks to smoke a little herb."
pf16129.7,"It doesn't keep her from sounding bitter, but at least makes her bitterness entertaining."
pf16280.1,"Trekking to Africa for a bit of extra musical flavor has long been one of the more dubious traditions in Western pop, with the results too often no better than hauling back some exotic souvenir or ornament."
pf16538.7,"They've chosen to work again with producer Jim Diamond, who's also recorded the White Stripes and the Electric Six, and he keeps the sound raw even as the band honeys up its melodies and writes more nuanced songs."
pf16625.18,"""Otenga"" is a surging dance track that uses the flute as a rhythm instrument and features an odd horn that resembles a distorted percussion instrument."
pf16691.13,"Nevertheless, there are moments of genuine and heartbreaking clarity on all three discs in this set, when Lee speaks creatively and strongly or when the band hits an effortless groove."
pf16835.19,"vomits, flanged crescendos, and some right pretty guitars (respect), an uninspired sameness eclipses the proficiency."
pf16960.9,"is the record's rousing singalong, augmenting rough electric guitar with a shouted, glasses-raised chorus."
pf16966.19,At least the album's mediocrity isn't particularly offensive or annoying.
pf17509.16,"They've got some things going for them: a few of these songs are tremendously catchy; they're funny and don't appear to take themselves seriously; LaLonde is the kind of loveable nerd you want to root for, even if he sounds like he's never heard a note sung by a guy with a decent haircut; the rhythm section wants to swing, even if they don't always manage; and their debut is only 16 minutes long."
pf17630.1,"The Mars Volta's piss-soaked indulgence often pushes critics to similarly bombastic, mouth-foaming performances."
pf17934.13,"On ""Un Beso Llega"", the song's two chords don't signify change or development so much as a weight shift."
pf18073.17,"The collaboration makes its most muscular avant-rock gestures on the bass-centered ""Die Farbe as dem All"", a loose-tongued megalith that would've sounded right at home on NNCK's 2005 Qvaris album."
pf18397.27,"For live tracks we get ""Thieves"", ""Psalm 69"", and ""The Fall"", all from 2002's Sphinctour."
pf18535.8,"And he loved it not only for the humor inherent in seconds-long songs like Napalm Death's ""You Suffer"", but because it seemed like a direct extension of his love for punk rock."
pf18772.3,"Their stately, melodic indie pop gives them a big enough palette with which to paint albums that don't lose their flavor on the bedpost overnight, but it also means that their records can feel interchangeable."
pf19200.3,"On Okkervil River's fourth album, Black Sheep Boy, he oversings beyond the limits of taste and vocal cords, either belting the notes forcefully or overenunciating his syllables at quieter moments."
pf19597.15,Not So Much is suffused with this creative love.
pf20149.3,"While never groundbreaking, musical sojourns like those upon which Summer Hymns embark aren't easy to execute, and bear copious rewards when done well. 2000's Voice Brother and Sister and its successor, A Celebratory Arm Gesture, painted glorious, imagistic portraits of a Pan-South in eternal bloom, a fantastical vision that was in some ways better than the real thing for their kindly manipulation of the mind's eye. 2003's Clemency marked a change of direction, ruefully striking towards homogeneous country-rock territory yet managing to avoid cliché with a barrelful of strong melodies."
pf20267.18,"""Si Me Quieres Escribir"" and ""El Cant Dels Ocells"" sound particularly amateurish, laboring in the saturnine dynamics that come to typify this record."
pf20339.46,"truly important, though, is that it's focused intently on probing social issues in meaningful ways."
pf20417.15,"That might be interesting if there were some juxtaposition between their stubborn politeness and Gab's lyrical content, but his flows flow with the same caveats-- an often boring technical precision and a hamfisted deference to moralizing and finger-wagging."
pf20522.15,"That's a mixed-blessing, sadly; just like the classics from which they draw their sound, it proves to be as intermittently refreshing as it is ultimately monotonous."
pf20708.5,"Both spring forward, showcasing several distinct melodies, which gives the impression that you've just heard four songs in eight minutes."
pf20769.19,But permit me to make amends for my long and tedious-- and perhaps unfair-- grievances.
pf20989.4,"Critically speaking, bands who gravitate toward change get high marks for their willingness to continually invent and to challenge convention; the water-treaders simply get fans."
pf21125.9,"Mukai announced the arrival of ""Street Surgery 2"" with the atonal manipulation of his fabricated bass, which slowly evolved into an awkward-yet-interesting, Indian-inspired backwards phrase before juxtaposing with a lower register polka-dance bassline."
pf21271.27,"Marumari's ""Saka"" has an electric guitar, but the clean tone and processed slides, bumping up against some piano tinkling and choppy percussion, give the track a laptop folk feel."
pf21285.20,"This is no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub, just the same old aimless weed-soaked jams."
pf21413.27,"Largely missing Fischer's distinctive vocal interactions, while reflecting his increased complacency with sitting on single (albeit noisy) chords for indeterminable amounts of time, A Better Version wasn't so much deserving of scorn as it was yawningly bland."
pf21722.7,"For all practical purposes, Hum came to an end after a bus accident in Canada (a fitting anti-climax) in 1999 but played two reunion shows on December 29th and 31st of 2000."
pf21741.21,"The band's delivery is dispassionate and inert, and the deep mood swings that have typified some of their best outings-- the spiritual highs and dramatic depths-- are entirely absent."
pf21873.4,"If Boom Box 2000's goal was to make an album so horrible that it exposed post-millennial hip-hop as a vapid, disposable art form, they should at least take comfort in achieving the first half of their goal."
pf22233.26,"It's not unfortunate so much as it is just a fact, but much of the rest of the album is more pedestrian, weighing in with melodies and compositions that tend towards the ""pop"" end of the folk-pop spectrum."
pf22237.11,"Initially, this seems to be a neat concept in making a ""solo"" record, because the resulting sound should reflect more than just the idiosyncratic vision of the writer."
pf22267.7,"Each of the fourteen songs has its own, creative sound: the guitar and vocal effects on ""{ {}}} {{},"" the lilting, lush melody of ""Arbor Day,"" or Sandra Shockley-Laden's gossamer flute backdrop on ""Throttle."""
pf22493.45,"In ten years, you'll be mistaking their superficial work here for the Chemical Brothers, Crystal Method, or Fatboy Slim's big-beat bullshit."
pf23057.3,"Despite early promise, IQU has stumbled badly in establishing any kind of momentum, a trend that continues with this, their second consecutive ho-hum EP stuffed with remixes."
pf24054.23,"In the final moments of Burn Your Fire, Olsen asked, “Won’t you open a window sometime/What’s so wrong with the light?”"
pf24145.24,"The album is an epic holiday buffet of tendentious feminist fuck-off, with second helpings for anonymous commenters and music industry blood-suckers."
pf24199.18,"The projects often felt like extended stylistic experiments, ranging wildly in quality—but when inspiration struck, it sounded like nothing else coming out of his Atlanta hometown, from guileless outsider-pop ballads to completely unclassifiable vocal performance clinics."
pf24694.10,"Heems told The Village Voice he chooses beats ""so Talib Kweli fans wouldn't like it,"" but while Das Racist go great lengths to separate themselves from the pejorative connotations of ""lyrical hip-hop,"" the main draw are the lyrics."
pf24799.29,Darnielle is a professed fan.
pf24886.35,"As it turned out, they created an album we’ll probably never hear the likes of again—good thing it’s deep enough to live in forever."
pf25072.11,"They always claim they'd rather keep messing around with new ideas than settle down and crank out the hits that are at their fingertips, which is one reason 2004's Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes felt more eclectic than excellent."
pf25148.41,"The maddening contradiction, the goofball ridiculousness, and the furious fist-raising still comprise an original voice."
pf25318.15,"It's winningly clever, and even if it's not the deepest song in their repertoire, you have to credit Meloy's enthusiasm when he practically drools the word ""stevedore."""
